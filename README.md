## Learning Journey
This project is inspired by and follows along with the amazing Flutter course by [Vandad Nahavandipoor](https://github.com/vandadnp).  Throughout the development of this app, I gained practical knowledge in various aspects of mobile development, including:

- **Flutter**: Understanding the framework's core concepts, including widgets, state management, navigation, and building responsive UIs.
- **Dart**: Mastering the language that powers Flutter, including object-oriented programming, asynchronous programming with `async` and `await`, and working with streams.
- **Mobile App Design with Figma**: Learning to design user interfaces and create prototypes using Figma, ensuring that the app is both visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **Mobile Development Best Practices**: Applying best practices for building cross-platform apps, such as managing app lifecycle, handling device compatibility, and creating responsive layouts.
- **Integration with Firebase**: Setting up and integrating Firebase services for authentication and data storage using Firestore, making the app secure and reliable.
